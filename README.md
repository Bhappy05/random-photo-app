# Random Photo App by Denis Kovalev
⚠️ Please Note that this is a live project

This app was developed to practice programming with Swift and enhance my understanding of unit and UI testing using XCTest, it is primarily designed for personal development.
The application is comprehensively tested, with all features covered by either UI or unit tests. A shared MockURLProtocol class was created to handle mocking across all tests. For UI testing, environment variables and session overrides were implemented within SceneDelegate to simulate and test different scenarios effectively.
Through developing this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the structure of Swift applications, the fundamentals of unit testing, and the process of data mocking. I also improved my skills in writing comprehensive UI tests, ensuring that the app functions smoothly across various scenarios.
